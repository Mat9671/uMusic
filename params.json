The information available includes:\r\n\r\n###Artist Information\r\nOne of the strongest side of the application is artist information. It is group members (if a band), groups (if a single artist), releases, labels, tracks, among other content. The source of information is the [Discogs](http://discogs.com) large database of user input.\r\n\r\n###Music Lyrics\r\nEver wanted to share a little piece of that great song lyrics? Well, that got easy enough that you could do it singing.\r\nThe lyrics search and sharing is another great point of the application, leaving aside the fact of saving the music lyrics on the MP3 file itself, of course.\r\n\r\n##Links\r\n* [Google+ Beta Testing Community](http://bit.ly/19dIgb2 \"uMusic Beta Testing\")\r\n* [Email me](mailto:guilhermeventura2@gmail.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
