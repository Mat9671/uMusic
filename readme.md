#uMusic
**Note:** The application is not released yet. It is under development and has no official release date.
##Introduction
In the application, it will be possible to:
* Edit MP3 metadata tags;
* Search for artist information, such as releases, labels, and so on;
* Search music's lyrics; and
* Play music!

		More features may appear during development.

##Content
The application uses several APIs to bring to the user a ton of information
about his/her favorite music, artist and labels. The information available includes:

###Artist Information
One of the strongest side of the application is artist information. It is group members (if a band), groups (if a single artist), releases, labels, tracks, among other content. The source of information is the [Discogs](http://discogs.com) large database of user input.

###Music Lyrics
Ever wanted to share a little piece of that great song lyrics? Well, that got easy enough that you could do it singing.
The lyrics search and sharing is another great point of the application, leaving aside the fact of saving the music lyrics on the MP3 file itself, of course.
